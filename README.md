This repo makes use of access wideners to fix an issue that prevents modded sign drops.
It is assumed that you know how to enable access wideners for your mod, but an explanation can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:accesswideners) if needed.

Note that, while not included in this repo, you still need a model and blockstate for your sign block to give it break particles.
